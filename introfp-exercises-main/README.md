# IntroFP Exercises

This repository contains a small Haskell source file that you can use for doing 
the exercises. It is possible with this repository to run GHCi in a Docker 
container using Visual Studio Code.

Open the folder with Visual Studio Code and accept the option to re-open the
folder using the development container. Open a terminal and start GHCi by 
typing `ghci` on the command line and press 'enter'. This will run the 
interpreter and then you can follow the steps as described in the assignment.

Good luck!
